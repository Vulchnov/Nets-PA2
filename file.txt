Descripon.
In this assignment, you will be wri4ng a TCP server and client, where the TCP serverâ€™s job is to
take input requests from a TCP client to generate hash and send it back to the client. The client
has a file and wants to obtain the hashes for various segments of the data inside the file. The
client will send a message to the server for each segment, and the server will respond with the
hash of the segment. The client converts each hash into a hexadecimal string representa4on and
prints it to the console. The server must be able to handle more than one client concurrently.
The details of the protocol followed in this case is described below.
Protocol Overview.
The protocol between the client and server
will use four types of messages:
Ini$aliza$on, Acknowledgement,
HashRequest, and HashResponse. The client
starts by sending an Ini$aliza$on message to
the server, which informs the server of the
size of the input data that the client will send
(denoted by the variable S). AIerwards, the
client sends N HashRequest messages to the
server, where each HashRequest contains
the data segment to be hashed. The server
responds to the Ini$aliza$on message with
an Acknowledgement, which informs the
client about the total length of the response
(40*S). AIer this, the server responds to each HashRequest with a HashResponse that contains
the hash of the corresponding data included in HashRequest.
Format of messages.
For the sake of convenience, all the messages in this protocol follow same structure as shown
below. However, some of the aPributes in the messages will be different depending on the type
of message.
